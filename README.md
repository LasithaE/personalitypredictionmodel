# personalitypredictionmodel
This was a college group project relatedto machine Learning. We all love giving personality quizzes, so we thought, "Why not make one?". The whole project revolves around the Big Five Personality traits or popularly known as the OCEAN model or the Five Factor Model(FFM). We obtained the datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/big-five-personality-test) which contains almost a million people's dataset, answering 20 questions, within which 10 questions each are related to 1 personality. We used Mini Batch K-means Algorithm, and the libraries used are pandas, matplotlib, numpy and sklearn. The webframework used here is Flask. </br>
